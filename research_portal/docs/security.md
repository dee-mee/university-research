# Security Documentation

## Security Overview
The Field Data Collection System implements multiple layers of security to protect data and ensure system integrity. This document outlines the security features, best practices, and guidelines for maintaining a secure environment.

## Authentication & Authorization

### 1. User Authentication
- Token-based authentication
- Session-based authentication
- Two-factor authentication (optional)
- Password complexity requirements
- Password expiration policy

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Superuser: Full system access
- Administrator: Device and user management
- Analyst: Data analysis and reporting
- Operator: Basic device operations
- Viewer: Read-only access

## Data Protection

### 1. Data Encryption
- Data at rest: AES-256 encryption
- Data in transit: TLS/SSL encryption
- Database encryption: Transparent Data Encryption
- Key management: Hardware Security Module (HSM)

### 2. Data Validation
- Input sanitization
- XSS protection
- SQL injection prevention
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting

## Network Security

### 1. Transport Security
